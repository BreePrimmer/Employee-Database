# Employee-Database

## Description

This is a mySQL project that uses node.js in order to create a database with employee information. I wanted to create this program to get practice using mySQL and mySQL2. I learned how to join tables together to make new tables, and learned how to use mySQL2 and inquirer together to make this program.

## Installation

This program uses inquirer and mysql2. To install them, run 'npm install' in the shell.

## Usage

To start the program, enter 'node index.js'. A menu will pop up, and you can choose an option by using the arrow keys and pressing 'enter'. There are options to view tables, or add to the tables. Follow the prompts to update the table information.
